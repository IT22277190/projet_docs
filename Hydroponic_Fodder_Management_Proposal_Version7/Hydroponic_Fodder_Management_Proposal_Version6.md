1. ## <a name="xe3d0fc0bea9a42ce7605565d0964033d7f6ee47"></a>**Introduction**
Hydroponic fodder production delivers high-nutrient feed using minimal land and water. Precise management is key for optimal yield and quality. This proposal presents a robust IoT- and ML-driven system that automates data acquisition, environmental control, and plant health monitoring, leveraging modern web/IoT stacks and advanced machine learning (ML) mode.
1. ## **Research Problem**
   ##
Despite the benefits of hydroponic fodder systems, several challenges hinder optimal performance:

- Manual environmental monitoring is labor-intensive and prone to error.
- Maintaining optimal growth conditions for diverse plant species, especially across different growth phases, is complex.
- Early detection of plant stress, disease, or system errors is often delayed without automated vision and analytics.
- Resource usage (water, nutrients, energy) can be suboptimal without predictive, adaptive control.
